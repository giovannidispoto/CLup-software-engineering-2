\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
%During the first part of Covid-19 pandemic was figured out the problem of manage people at grocery store. Outside these buildings roads were tons of people enquequed waiting for their turn to buy food, waiting time that could be spent in other activities.\textbf{CLup} allows to manage customers in order to minimize the time spent enqueued and also avoiding crowd inside the building, suggesting to people the right route in order to buy everything that they need, minimizing the flow inside ward departement. With CLup user can get a ticket and know at what time he should be at grocery store. The system is able to estimate time needed to user to get to grocery store and decide if he has to denqueued because doesn't have enough time for reach the position. Users can also book a slot of time to do their shopping. Using this option he need to provide to the system categories of items that he need or better the shopping list. This information is useful due to trace a correct path inside the building and also to load balancing areas. 
%\yasmin{ho provato a riscriverlo usando delle tue parti ma cambiando qualcosa}
The aim of the following documentation is to provide an overview of the project \textit{CLup - Customes Line-up}: an application whose goal is to allow customers to shop safely. During the Covid-19 pandemic a new problem arose in people's lives. In a world where social distance is no longer a choice but a necessity, it must be found a way to ensure the safety of people in their daily lives, even in places open to the public, such as grocery stores. Having to comply with health and hygiene regulations, grocery stores were not allowed to enter more than a certain number of people, with the result of the formation of very long queues outside the buildings. \textbf{CLup} allows to manage customers in order to minimize their time spent enqueued and avoiding crowd inside the building. With CLup the customer can line from home getting a ticket for the grocery store or book a specific time-slot for their needs. This documentation will illustrate a description of the system in terms of its functional and non-functional requirements. We are going to show goals, constraints, limits and principal use cases of the software. In practice, this document will provide a baseline for the project planning and estimation. The document is addressed to the developers, that will implement the requirements, and to the stakeholders, that will supervise the development process.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{intro:purpose}
Customer Line-up (CL-up) is an application that aims to provide users with the tools to obtain access to Stores in a safe way, i.e. in order to avoid as much as possible the presence of external people (queues to enter) and to allow a number of internal people (number of people entered in the Store) lower than the allowed limit of each Store. All of this is made in order to comply as much as possible with any social distancing rules required by the competent authorities. To pursue this goal, the application provides a service both to the owners of the Stores (or whoever takes their place), that is the Managers, and to the buyers, that is the Customers. The application allows Users to create a different type of profile based on their identity, intended precisely as a Manager or Customer. Tools are provided to allow Customers to book for entry to the Stores remotely, that is for example from their own home, allowing a greater and more efficient social distancing.\\
\\
There are 2 ways offered by CLup to enter the Stores. The first concerns the collection of a Ticket that will put the Customer in a virtual queue to enter the Store on the same day. The application has also the role of alert the Customer in order to let him/her arrive in time for his/her turn, checking and keeping track of the state of the virtual queue. The second allows the Customer to book a Visit, that is an entrance to the Store on a specific day, for a specific shopping time-range. To book a Visit the Customer must also specify the category of groceries he/her is intended to buy, in order to assign him/her a map of the Store and an optimal route for his/her Visit. Furthermore, the application to be as efficient and simple as possible for users, will not only advise them a time of stay in the Store based on the user's data (that on his old time stays), but will also recommend which Stores are available or closest, always based on the user's habits.\\
\\
Regarding Managers, the application gives them the possibility to create a specialized profile in which they can request 'the creation of a Store', i.e. a virtual space that will be identified as their own Store, and through which Customers will be able to book Tickets or Visits to enter the shop itself. The Managers have in fact the task of inserting and helping the application in the creation and definition of the Store and it's rules. All this information may vary over time and must be kept up to date in order to guarantee a better service of the application.\\
\\
To guarantee entry only for Customers authorized to enter at that moment, whether they have requested a Ticket or a Visit, a QR code is checked. In practice, each Customer is associated with a QR code that will appear in his profile. At the entrance, this QR code must be scanned to verify that the Customer has actually booked the Visit for that moment or that it is his turn to enter via Ticket. Moreover, to allow the virtual queue to slide adequately, each QR code must be scanned also at the exit.\\
\\
Finally, to allow entry to those who do not have the adequate technology to use the application, a secondary option must be put in place, i.e. a fallback option. To allow anyone to collect a Ticket, we have opted for adding Totems at the entrance that have the ability to print Tickets.

\section{Overall Description}
\label{overallDescription}

\subsection{Product perspective}
In this section we are analyzing all the shared phenomena listed before
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Customer register to Service}: If a Customer wants to register to the service he have to provide email and password.
When the process is completed, the System generate an unique QR code associated to him, used when he goes to stores.

\item \textbf{Manager register to Service}: If a Manager wants to register has to provide his/her email and password. 

\item \textbf{Customer get a ticket}: When the customer wants to go to a Store, he needs to login in into the application, search for a Store near him and enqueuing. In this instant the System provide a time 

\item \textbf{Scan QR Code}: Before entering and exit employees scan Customers QR code in order to validate the ticket and collect information used for profiling.

\item \textbf{Customer books a visit}: When a customer books a visit he have to specify where he wants to go and choosing a time-slot available and insert the categories of items that he have to buy. 

\item \textbf{Alert Customer}: The System alert the Customer in order to remind the him that he booked a Visit or for the ticket, in time to let him be in time for it.
For doing this he have to specify what type of means of transport he use.

\item \textbf{Showing Map during the Shopping}: In order to minimize the time spent inside the Store
and for avoid too much interaction with other user, the application suggest a path to the customer using information of categories of item he wants to buy.

\item \textbf{Computing statistics of the Customer}: In order to improve the user experience, the application compute statistics of Stores visited, time spent and in general their habits. These information are used for suggest stores, time-slots and the shopping time. %\giovanni{Se invece il cliente non inserisce il tempo di visita per il ticket, c'Ã¨ bisogno di prevderlo} \yasmin{se non lo inserisce non puÃ² ordinarlo, no?} \giovanni{Era relativo al problema che ci eravamo posti su far inserire il tempo di permanenza nel momento in cui si prende un ticket}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Product functions}
Detailed description of the product functions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Get a Ticket}
    \begin{flushleft}
        A Customer correctly logged in, can see all the near store. After selecting one, he/she can get a ticket. In order to get a ticket he/she have to specify the duration of the shopping and the means of transport that he/she want to use to get to store. For long term Customer the time of the shopping is inferred and suggested using historical information.
        After providing this information, the System checks that there are no ovelapped reservation.
        Before confirm, the Customer can see how much time he/she have to wait before entering in. During this phase, the System check that the user can satisfy time constrain. If not, reject the request.
        After enquequing, the System continue to keep track of the user, in order to alert him/her to depart from home.
    \end{flushleft}

        \end{minipage}
    
    \item \textbf{Book a Visit}
    \begin{flushleft}
       A Customer correctly logged in, can see all the near store. After selecting one, he/she can book a visit. After selecting a store he/she have to specify the duration of the visit, select a time slot available and specify the categories of grocery that he/she want to buy in order to allow the System to calculate the best path in order to maximize social distancing. The time spent inside the grocery store is inferred and suggested using historical information.
       During the visit, the Customer can open the app and see the path suggested from the System.
    \end{flushleft}

        \end{minipage}
        
    \item \textbf{Add a Store}
    \begin{flushleft}
        A Manager correctly logged in can add a new  Store.
        In order to create a Store a Manager should specify the name of the store, the address, the maximum number of people that can enter inside the store according to health directives, maximum number of people for each department of the store and opening hours. During this phase the Manager could specify other Managers of the store. After creation, he/she have to specify also credentials used by the System to verify that the store exists. At the end of this phase, a Manager upload a map of the stores, reporting information of the store such as walls, departments and category of grocery for each department.
    \end{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{Manage a Store}
    \begin{flushleft}
        A Manager correctly logged in can edit information of all his stores. He/she can edit the maximum number of people according to new health directives, modify the maximum number of people inside each department, map of the stores. He/she can also modify the managers, transfer ownership or delete a store from the System.
    \end{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{Perform a visit with ticket on App}
    \begin{flushleft}
        When is the turn of a Customer enqueque, before entering, he/she have to show his/her qr code to scanner machine in order to register the visit. \giovanni{Cosa accade durante la spesa se il tempo sfora quello richiesto?}.
        Once the Customer finish his shopping, during the payment, he/she scan one more time the qr code, in order to register the exit
    \end{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{Perform a visit with paper ticket}
     \begin{flushleft}
        When the Customer arrives to the grocery stores, get a ticket from the ticket machine. On the ticket is printed the entering time. Before entering the Customer have to show the qr code to scanner machine. Once the Customer finish his shopping, during the payment, he/she scan one more time the qr code, in order to register the exit
    \end{flushleft}
    \item \textbf{Perform a booked visit}
    \begin{flushleft}
        Before entering, the Customer scan his/her qr code. When he/she is inside, he can open the app and see the calculated path to follow in order to buy everything that he/she needs. Once the Customer finish his shopping, during the payment, he/she scan one more time the qr code, in order to register the exit
    \end{flushleft}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsection{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}
\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}[label={DA.\arabic{*}}]
    \item \label{dom:fewPaperTickets} 
We assume that Paper Tickets will be few as in a situation of health emergency and social distancing people are invited to stay indoors.\lorenzo{FORSE NON TROPPO CHIARO}
    \item \label{dom:machineScanning}Each Store provides at least a Machine for Scanning.
    \item \label{dom:machinePaperTicket}Each Store provides at least as Machine for generating Paper Tickets.
    \item \label{dom:consumerAccessStore}The Consumers who enter a Store use a ticket, a paper ticket or a Visit and the vast majority of them scan their QR both at the entrance and at the exit.

        \item \label{req:codeUnique:queueReservations} Every time a Consumer makes a Reservation, it is occupied an element in every Temporal Quantum he needs, that is the Duration of Shopping divided by 5, if and only if the System can find sequential empty spaces (ie an empty space in different subsequent Temporal Quantums of the queue) within the queue. The spaces occupied in each Temporal Quantum will be the first available in that Temporal Quantum.
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:visitsAndQueue} Consumers who have booked a Visit will be inserted in the same queue of the ones who have got a (paper or virtual) Ticket, but they will have higher priority.

        \item \label{req:codeUnique:scalingExceed} During the Queue Scaling Process, any scaling that causes a Reservation to exceed the closing hours will lead to the cancellation of the Reservation.
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:scalingOverlap} During the Queue Scaling Process, any scaling that causes a Virtual Ticket or Visit to overlap with another Virtual Ticket or Visit of the same Costumer (also for different Stores), there will be a cancellation of one of the Reservations. \yasmin{dovrei specificare con quale prioritÃ } 
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:queueNotifications} Every time a Reservation is cancelled, the Customer must be notified.
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:queueLast30} The last 30 minutes in which a Store is open cannot be booked by any type of Reservation, so that they can be exploited within the Queue Scaling Process, in order to eventually have to eliminate a smaller number of Reservations.
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:queueReset} When the Store closes (each day) the queue resets it states, keeping only the booked Visits for the next days.
        \item \label{req:codeUnique:reset} The queue should be made in such a way that after the closing hours of a Store, it delete every old Reservations, that is every Reservation made for that day. In this way just future booked Visits are preserved.
        \item \label{moreOpeningHours} The queue has to be made in such a way that if there are more opening and closing hours of a Store in a single day, the number of intermediate Temporal Quantums (in which the Store is closed) must be blocked. This means that those blocked Temporal Quantums cannot be booked and it is not possible to make scales that go beyond them.
        
        %\item \lorenzo{DA METTERE NELLE DEFINIZIONI O SPECIFICHE}Queue Scaling: the system checks if the number of people in the Store is less than or equal of the capacity of the store in each period of time (this will be chosen during the implementation process). If not, the system will change the entrance time of some customers to validate the aforementioned constraint. The order of the people with online tickets and booked visits in the queue will be preserved . The time of entrance can be only delayed. The time of entrance of people with paper ticket is frozen (cannot be changed).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item \label{req:inferringSuggestions}Suggestions are based on the habits of the Customers, inferred by the Data Analytics Manager. In a first period will be suggested Stores which are available and geographically close to the Customer (within 1 km).
